# Design Reference Documents

This folder contains architectural documentation you may need to reference during development.

## Contents

- `Folder_Structure_Design.md` — How your code should be organized
- `Metadata_Design.md` — The .metadata.json file structure and purpose
- `TDD_Approach.md` — Test-driven development workflow

## When to Read These

- **Before starting**: Read all three to understand the architecture
- **During development**: Reference them when you're unsure about structure or format
- **Metadata files**: Refer to this when creating .metadata.json files

These are reference documents only—they don't change during development, but they're essential for understanding how everything fits together.
