# Step 3 & 3.2: Observation (Folders and Functions)

This folder contains **everything** you need to implement Steps 3 and 3.2. This is your complete, isolated workspace.

## Files in This Folder

- `step_3_observation_folders.md` — Complete instructions for Step 3
- `step_3_2_observation_functions.md` — Complete instructions for Step 3.2
- `Agent_Notes.md` — **CREATE THIS** - Your working notes during development
- `Implementation_Log.md` — **CREATE THIS** - Log of what you've done
- `DESIGN_REFERENCE/` — Reference documentation (read as needed)

## Workflow for Both Steps

### Step 3
1. **Read** `step_3_observation_folders.md` completely
2. **Write** tests (as specified)
3. **Implement** code to pass tests
4. **Confirm** with Owen that Step 3 is complete

### Step 3.2
1. **Read** `step_3_2_observation_functions.md` completely
2. **Write** tests (as specified)
3. **Implement** code to pass tests
4. **Confirm** with Owen that Step 3.2 is complete

### Documentation
- **Create** `Agent_Notes.md` to track your understanding as you go
- **Create** `Implementation_Log.md` documenting what you did

## Important Notes

- You have access to Steps 1 and 2 code you wrote
- All previous tests should still pass
- These two steps are related (Step 3.2 extends Step 3)
- Test files are provided in the test_data folder

## After These Steps

When Steps 3 & 3.2 are complete:
- Owen will collect `Agent_Notes.md` and `Implementation_Log.md`
- These files will be removed from your workspace
- Step 4 folder will be prepared with knowledge from your logs
- You'll get Step 4 files

**Important**: You only have access to files in THIS folder (and previous code you wrote). No cross-step file access beyond your own code.
