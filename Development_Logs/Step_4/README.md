# Step 4.1 & 4.2: Test Functions and Execution Engine

This folder contains **everything** you need to implement Steps 4.1 and 4.2. This is your complete, isolated workspace.

## Files in This Folder

- `step_4_1_test_functions.md` — Complete instructions for Step 4.1
- `step_4_2_execution_engine.md` — Complete instructions for Step 4.2
- `Agent_Notes.md` — **CREATE THIS** - Your working notes during development
- `Implementation_Log.md` — **CREATE THIS** - Log of what you've done
- `DESIGN_REFERENCE/` — Reference documentation (read as needed)

## Workflow for Both Steps

### Step 4.1
1. **Read** `step_4_1_test_functions.md` completely
2. **Write** tests (as specified)
3. **Implement** code to pass tests
4. **Confirm** with Owen that Step 4.1 is complete

### Step 4.2
1. **Read** `step_4_2_execution_engine.md` completely
2. **Write** tests (as specified)
3. **Implement** code to pass tests
4. **Confirm** with Owen that Step 4.2 is complete

### Documentation
- **Create** `Agent_Notes.md` to track your understanding as you go
- **Create** `Implementation_Log.md` documenting what you did

## Important Notes

- You have access to Steps 1, 2, 3, and 3.2 code you wrote
- All previous tests should still pass
- Step 4.1 (test functions) is used by Step 4.2 (execution engine)
- Test data and example graphs are provided

## After These Steps

When Steps 4.1 & 4.2 are complete:

**v0.1 MVP is DONE!** 🎉

- Owen will collect `Agent_Notes.md` and `Implementation_Log.md`
- Complete Jarvis v0.1 is ready for testing and refinement
- Future development can begin

## Summary of What You've Built

If you're reading this at the end of Step 4.2, you've successfully implemented:

- ✅ **Step 1**: CLI that accepts commands
- ✅ **Step 2**: Graph data structure (nodes, edges, persistence)
- ✅ **Step 3**: Folder observation (scan folders, create graphs)
- ✅ **Step 3.2**: Function observation (extract Python functions)
- ✅ **Step 4.1**: Test utility functions (add, multiply, concat, etc.)
- ✅ **Step 4.2**: Execution engine (run linked functions)

**Jarvis v0.1 complete!**
