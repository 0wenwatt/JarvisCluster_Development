# Agent Workspace - Step 4

This folder is **your private workspace** for this step.

---

## Rules

✅ **ALLOWED**:
- Create `.md` (markdown) files here
- Document your progress
- Write notes about decisions
- Track questions and issues

❌ **NOT ALLOWED**:
- Create code files (`.py`, `.js`, etc.) here
- Create other file types
- Build/test in this folder

---

## Why This Folder Exists

When you complete Step 4:

1. **Your code persists** → `jarvis/test_functions.py`, `jarvis/execution.py` stay in repo
2. **This folder is deleted** → Everything here is removed
3. **Your notes are saved** → Files here get copied to design repo
4. **Knowledge transfer** → Owen reviews your notes for v0.2 planning

---

## What To Document

Consider creating these files:

- **Progress.md** — What you've completed
- **Questions.md** — Questions for Owen about v0.2 direction
- **Decisions.md** — Design choices you made (function lookup, chaining logic, etc.)
- **Challenges.md** — Problems you solved (dynamic imports, output passing, etc.)
- **Learnings.md** — What you discovered about execution engines

---

## Owen Will Review

After you finish, Owen will read:
- Your implementation in `jarvis/test_functions.py` and `jarvis/execution.py`
- Your tests in `tests/test_step_4_1.py` and `tests/test_step_4_2.py`
- **Your notes in this folder**

Your notes help Owen understand your approach and prepare v0.2 planning with relevant insights.
