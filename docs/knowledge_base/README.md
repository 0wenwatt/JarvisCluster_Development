# Knowledge Base

This directory contains consolidated summaries and reference materials about the Jarvis architecture and design decisions.

## Files

- **architecture_plan.md** - Consolidated architecture summary including:
  - Component overview
  - Technology stack
  - Data flows
  - Design principles
  - Development phases
  - Key architectural decisions

## Purpose

The knowledge base provides:
- Quick reference for architecture information
- Summaries of key design decisions
- Consolidated view of system components
- Development phase overviews
- Integration points and external dependencies

## Usage

This is a **reference directory** - information here is summarized from the main design documents:
- [DESIGN_PLAN.md](../../DESIGN_PLAN.md) - Complete system design
- [USE_CASES.md](../../USE_CASES.md) - Detailed use cases
- [JARVIS_FILE_TREE.md](../../JARVIS_FILE_TREE.md) - Full implementation structure

## Relationship to Other Docs

```
Main Documents (authoritative)
├── DESIGN_PLAN.md        → Detailed architecture
├── USE_CASES.md          → Usage examples
├── JARVIS_FILE_TREE.md   → Implementation details
└── REQUIREMENTS.md       → Standards & practices

└── architecture_plan.md  → Quick reference combining above
```

## When to Update

Update knowledge base summaries when:
- Major architectural decisions are made
- Component responsibilities change
- New phases or milestones are defined
- Integration points are added or modified

Always update the main documents first, then reflect changes here.
