## 📋 Summary

This section tracks the **current state** of Jarvis development, comparing actual implementation progress against planned structure and documenting deviations, metrics, and next steps.

---

## 🎯 Agent Instructions for This Section

When working with tracking information:
- **Snapshot in Time**: Tracking data represents point-in-time status
- **Auto-Generated**: Much of this content is generated by scripts
- **Read for Context**: Check current state before proposing changes
- **Update After Work**: Update DEV_STATE.md after completing significant work
- **Report Deviations**: Document when actual diverges from plan (with rationale)

---

## 📊 Completion by Priority

| Priority | Target Files | Created | Functions | Implemented | Completion |
|----------|--------------|---------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| P0 (MVP) | ~30 | 0 | ~120 | 0 | 0% |
| P1 (Core) | ~25 | 0 | ~100 | 0 | 0% |
| P2 (Advanced) | ~15 | 0 | ~80 | 0 | 0% |
| P3 (Optional) | ~4 | 0 | ~30 | 0 | 0% |

*Note: These numbers reflect the implementation repository, not this planning repo*

## 🔍 How to Use This Section

### Before Starting Work
1. Check [current-status.md](current-status.md) for latest state
2. Review next priorities and active tasks
3. Ensure you're working on the right priority level
4. Check for blockers or dependencies

### During Development
1. Run comparison tools to validate progress
2. Update DEV_STATE.md with significant milestones
3. Document deviations from plan with rationale
4. Track metrics if working on measurable goals

### After Completing Work
1. Update [current-status.md](current-status.md)
2. Generate new comparison report
3. Update completion percentages
4. Document lessons learned
5. Update roadmap if timeline changes

---

## 🛠️ Tracking Automation

### Automated Tracking System
The tracking system automatically:
1. Monitors the implementation repository
2. Generates snapshots at regular intervals
3. Compares against JARVIS_FILE_TREE.md
4. Produces comparison reports
5. Updates metrics dashboards

### Manual Tracking
When automation isn't available:
1. Manually update DEV_STATE.md
2. Use `compare_tree.py` script for comparisons
3. Document progress in tracking/snapshots/
4. Update metrics manually

## 🔗 Integration with Implementation Repo

### Sync Configuration
- **Config File**: `config/tracking-config.yaml`
- **Sync Frequency**: TBD (recommended: daily or per-commit)
- **Data Pulled**: File tree, function list, test results, metrics

### Comparison Process
1. Pull current state from implementation repo
2. Parse file structure and function definitions
3. Compare against JARVIS_FILE_TREE.md
4. Generate gap analysis
5. Update DEV_STATE.md
6. Create visual reports

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Planning Repo**: This repo tracks the planning/tracking hub, not implementation
- **Separate Implementation**: Actual Jarvis code lives in a different repository
- **Regular Updates**: Keep DEV_STATE.md fresh (recommended: weekly minimum)
- **Report Deviations**: When actual != plan, document why
- **Metrics Matter**: Use quantitative data to guide decisions
