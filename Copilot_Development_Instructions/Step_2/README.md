# Step 2: Graph/Nodes/Edges

This folder contains **everything** you need to implement Step 2. This is your complete, isolated workspace.

## Files in This Folder

- `step_2_graph_nodes_edges.md` — **READ THIS FIRST** - Complete implementation instructions
- `Agent_Notes.md` — **CREATE THIS** - Your working notes during development
- `Implementation_Log.md` — **CREATE THIS** - Log of what you've done
- `DESIGN_REFERENCE/` — Reference documentation (read as needed)

## Workflow

1. **Read** `step_2_graph_nodes_edges.md` completely
2. **Create** `Agent_Notes.md` to track your understanding
3. **Write** tests (as specified in the instruction file)
4. **Implement** code to pass tests
5. **Create** `Implementation_Log.md` documenting what you did
6. **Confirm** with Owen that Step 2 is complete

## Important Notes

- You have access to Step 1 code you wrote (it's in your jarvis/ package)
- You should understand Step 1 before starting Step 2
- Test files from Step 1 should still pass
- If you need info from Step 1, it's in your implementation

## After This Step

When Step 2 is complete:
- Owen will collect `Agent_Notes.md` and `Implementation_Log.md`
- These files will be removed from your workspace
- Step 3 folder will be prepared with knowledge from your logs
- You'll get Step 3 files

**Important**: You only have access to files in THIS folder (and previous code you wrote). No cross-step file access beyond your own code.
