# Step 1: Basic CLI

This folder contains **everything** you need to implement Step 1. This is your complete, isolated workspace.

## Files in This Folder

- `step_1_basic_cli.md` — **READ THIS FIRST** - Complete implementation instructions
- `Agent_Notes.md` — **CREATE THIS** - Your working notes during development
- `Implementation_Log.md` — **CREATE THIS** - Log of what you've done
- `DESIGN_REFERENCE/` — Reference documentation (read as needed)

## Workflow

1. **Read** `step_1_basic_cli.md` completely
2. **Create** `Agent_Notes.md` to track your understanding
3. **Write** tests (as specified in the instruction file)
4. **Implement** code to pass tests
5. **Create** `Implementation_Log.md` documenting what you did
6. **Confirm** with Owen that Step 1 is complete

## After This Step

When Step 1 is complete:
- Owen will collect `Agent_Notes.md` and `Implementation_Log.md`
- These files will be removed from your workspace
- Step 2 folder will be prepared with knowledge from your logs
- You'll get Step 2 files

**Important**: You only have access to files in THIS folder and your produced code. No cross-step access.
